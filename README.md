# Solidisk 128K 2MHz Expansion for BBC Micro

This is a reverse engineering of the Solidisk 128K 2MHz Expansion for
the BBC micro. I purchased this board in the 1980s and it served well
however recently it is causing issues and the BBC Micro will not boot!
I could not find a schematic so I have been reverse engineering by
using experience, photos of the board and bleeping out the tracks
using a DMM.

THIS IS MOSTLY COMPLETED BUT STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
